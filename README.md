## General Information
* This work originated a paper that was presented at the 48th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society - [IECON 2022](https://iecon2022.org/), 17-23 October 2022 - Brussels - Belgium.
* Program developed to provide, in real time, the reference value for the PI control of the biological reactor of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
* The program developed in Python optimizes the aeration system of a WWTP represented by the Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 (BSM2).
* Metaheuristic algorithms used:
  * Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  * Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
  * Simulated Annealing (SA)
